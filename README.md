# Analysis of the Verona COVID-19 cohort

This GitHub contains all the scripts used to analyze scRNA-seq and functional data.
Our single-cell analysis relies on the [**Pagoda2 pipeline**] (https://github.com/kharchenkolab/pagoda2/) while the viral landscape of patients' lung was assessed using [**Viral-Track**] (https://github.com/PierreBSC/Viral-Track/)
